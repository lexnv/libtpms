CHANGES - changes for libtpms

version 0.6.6
 - tpm2: NVMarshal: Handle index orderly RAM without 0-sized terminating node
 - tpm2: Initialize a whole OBJECT before using it

version 0.6.5
  - tpm2: Reset too large size indicators in TPM2B to avoid access beyond buffer
  - tpm2: Restore original value in buffer if unmarshalled one was illegal

version 0.6.4
  - tpm2: Fix public key context save due to ANY_OBJECT_Marshal usage
    This fixes a suspend/resume problem when public keys are
    loaded
  - tpm2: Address some Coverity issues (false positives)
  - tpm1.2: Backported ASAN/UBSAN related fixes

version 0.6.3
  - Fixed the set of PCRs belonging to the TCB group. This affects the
    pcrUpdateCounter in TPM2_Pcrread() responses, thus needs latest `swtpm`
    (master, stable branches) for test cases to succeed there.

version 0.6.2
  - compilation fixes for TPM 1.2 and various architectures and gcc versions
  - Fix support for NIST curves P{192,224,521} and SM2 P256 and BN P648
    that would not work;
  - Runtime filter elliptic curves (that OpenSSL does not support) and do
    not advertise those curves as capabilities
  - Removed unnecessary space in MANUFACTURER "IBM " -> "IBM"

version 0.6.1
  - CMAC code fix
  - Adapt code for OpenSSL 1.2 deprecated elliptic curve API calls

version 0.6.0
  - added TPM 2 support (revision 150)

  - New API calls:
    - TPMLIB_CancelCommand
    - TPMLIB_ChooseTPMVersion
    - TPMLIB_SetDebugFD
    - TPMLIB_SetDebugLevel
    - TPMLIB_SetDebugPrefix
    - TPMLIB_SetBufferSize
    - TPMLIB_ValidateState
    - TPMLIB_SetState
    - TPMLIB_GetState

version 0.5.1
  first public release

  - release 7 increased NVRAM area for being able to store more data in
    the TPM's NVRAM areas, i.e., X.509 certificates

  - release 9 added two more APIs:
    - TPM_Free
    - TPMLIB_DecodeBlob
